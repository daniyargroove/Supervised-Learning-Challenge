# Supervised-Learning-Challenge

Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. The reason is that healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. For this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

What was created:
Using knowledge of the imbalanced-learn library, I used a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset. First, I used the original dataset. Second, I resampled the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.

For both cases, I got the count of the target classes, trained a logistic regression classifier, calculated the balanced accuracy score, generated a confusion matrix, and generated a classification report.

As part of the README.md file in my GitHub repository, I created a credit risk analysis report based on the provided template in Starter_Code folder.

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
